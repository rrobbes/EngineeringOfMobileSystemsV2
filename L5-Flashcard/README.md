# Lab 5: understanding and extending the flashcard application

In this lab you will start with the flash card application [available here](https://snack.expo.io/@rrobbes/flash-cards). 

In its current state, the flash card application supports:

- selecting a deck of cards
- showing the cards in a deck, one by one
- recording whether a guess was right or wrong
- re-ordering the cards in a deck, putting the wrong cards first, then the unseen cards, then the right cards
- making sure the order of cards persists

It does so using the following components:

- A SelectDeck component to pick a deck among the available one, that has the overall state of the application
- A Deck component that keeps track of the guesses, and can re-order cards according to guesses
- A Card component that keeps track of whether the front or the back of the card is shown
- A Front component showing the front of the card, allowing to flip it
- A Back component showing the back of the card, allowing to record a guess as right or wrong

The goal of this lab is to extend the flash card application in a variety of ways.

## Code understanding task

The first task is to understand how the application works and how it is structured. To do so:

- take a sheet of paper, and list all of the components that the application defines, along with their props, state, and the types of props and states
- on another sheet of paper, display the components in a tree that matches the way they are organized in the UI

Feel free to use both sides of a single sheet, or a fancy tablet, instead :-).

Show how control flow affects the application. Annotate on the tree (possibly with different colors):
- how callbacks are passed down from parents to children components
- how these callbacks change the state of the applications 
- how changes of state change the tree of the application

## Starter task

Show some statistics while reviewing the cards in a deck. Show the number of cards reviewed, the number of cards left, and the number of  correct and incorrect guesses. These statistics should be defined in an independent component, that can be shown or hidden by the user.

Another possible starter task is to better style the components so that the card looks more like a an actual card.

## Editing a deck

Define a "deck editor" component, that allows the following operations:

- allow for the creation of new cards in a deck
- allow for the deletion of existing cards
- allow for the edition of an existing card
- allow for the renaming of a deck

The main application should allow to select a deck either for reviewing flashcards, or to edit the deck. Any change to the data structure should persist if you leave the screen (e.g., if you switch from reviewing one card deck to reviewer another one). Hint: give an id to components to allow the name of a deck to be edited. Note that at this stage, we don't know enough (yet) to make changes to the data persist if you leave or relaunch the application.

## Going further
After this you can go further, in the following ways:

- allow for the deck to be saved automatically, no need to press "restart" for this
- order the cards in a smarter fashion, by taking into account the time taken to flip the card (longer time => more difficult guess)
- allow for the addition of a new deck of cards
- allow for the deletion of a deck of cards
- improve the style the application, for instance by adding spacing between elements, using TouchableOpacity instead of buttons, adding a white  background to flashcards front and back
- simplify the code by using a single callback, with an argument, to record guesses, instead of using two callbacks

## Partial solution

A version of the flashcard application with the deck editor can be found [here](https://snack.expo.io/@rrobbes/flash-card-with-editor)
